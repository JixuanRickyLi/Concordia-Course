# How to run the program:
Note: The program was created using Jupyter Notebook, and each part (model) has been separated into it's own unique .ipynb file.

0. To ensure Jupyter is installed, open a command-line window and run the following command: `conda install jupyter`

1. To start the Jupyter Notebook instance, open a command-line window within the project's root directory.

5. To view the output .csv files, navigate to the /results directory and select any of the specific files. There is one subdirectory for each of the models (a through f) as to keep the folder organized. The training and testing sets' distribution graphs (images) can also be found within the /results directory as well.
