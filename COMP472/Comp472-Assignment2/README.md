# How to run the program:
1. Navigate to the root directory of the project in a terminal that supports Python (eg. PowerShell)
2. Run the main.py file by executing `python main.py`
3. To change which input file is read for the initial puzzle states, open the main.py file and modify the `input_file` value found in the __main__ code. Note: If a puzzle is meant to have more than 2 rows of data, the `number_of_rows` variable must also be changed accordingly. Furthermore, the specific timeout value can be adjusted using the `algorithm_timeout` variable.
4. To view the output files, wait until the application completes, and navigate to the /outputs/ directory.

# Contributions:
* Implementations for the Uniform Cost algorithm, and all other non-algorithm files (i.e. main.py, analytics.py, output_writer.py, random_input_generator.py, x_puzzle_solver.py, algorithms/helper.py (except for the heuristic functions), algorithms/node.py, scaling_up.py) as well as the demo slides were done by Andrew K. (40055081)
* Implementations for the A* algorithm as well as development of the heuristic functions were done by Janghuk B. (40005573)
* Implementations for the Greedy-Best-First-Search algorithm as well as development of the heuristic functions were done by Jixuan L. (40073785)
